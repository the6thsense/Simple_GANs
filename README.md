## Basic GANs to generate images of cats
1. limited by computation power
2. could generate highly pixelated images of cat 
3. learned to implement semi supervised learning as in gans
4. understood log loss and its implementation
6. tried various architectures from linear neural network to convolutinal in both discriminator and generator
